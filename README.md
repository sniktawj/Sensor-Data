This project is was created and worked on in ISAT 449. All credit for the design of the project goes to Dr. Tony Teate. 

This project focuses on supervised machine learning for sensor data classification. The dataset consists of 12 real-valued sensor measurements designed to detect the presence of one of two substances or a 'false alarm.' The goal is to build predictive models that classify substances based on the input sensor data.
